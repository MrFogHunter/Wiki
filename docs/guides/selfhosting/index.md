# Self Hosting

## Requirements

Hardware: 

1. A server / computer to run linux containers on. Docker Desktop with WSL also works, but isn't really recommended.

Software: 

1. `Docker` and `docker compose` installed on the server. You can use the [Docker install script](https://github.com/docker/docker-install) for linux, or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on Windows.

Other:

1. Domain name, setup to pointed towards your server, note : 
2. HTTPS - required for cookies to work securely. You can use cloudflare for lets encrypt for example.

note : <!-- comment for the validator it's one of the parts that blocked me at one point, my english doesn't help too much but I find it important to have an example and also to specify that you need 3 domains. -->
1. since several docker containers are exposed, this requires a specific dns configuration
   it's necessary to have 1 domain and 2 sub-domains pointing to the server here's an example
   if the domain used is openshock.local the .env will default to api.openshock.local and gateway.openshock.local so you'll need to point the domains in this way to the server ip 

2. if you use 3 sub-domains 
(does not work with cloudflare)
example
shock.openshock.local
the .env will work like this by default
for domaine shock.openshock.local 
api : api.shock.openshock.local
gateway : gateway.shock.openshock.local
you'll need to match your dns zone with the above sub-domains (adapted to your configuration) to the server's public ip 



## Preparing the server

Install software from the [Requirements](#requirements) on the server.

### generate valid https certificate (lets encrypt)
<!-- for the https part I must admit that it's a bit of a DIY job as I'm not totally familiar with docker but I wanted to do it the right way so I did it for myself afterwards I'll see about validation -->
1. Install Certbot ```sudo apt-get install certbot ``` for a debian 12 server my scenario for me
2. command to generate certificate two possible scenarios
3. if you use 3 subdomains for exemple (to suit your needs) ``` sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d shock.openshock.local -d api.shock.openshock.local -d gateway.shock.openshock.local``` command will create a single certificate containing the 3 sub-domains 
4. if you use 1 domain and 2 subdomain (to suit your needs) ``` sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d openshock.local -d api.openshock.local -d gateway.openshock.local``` command will create a single certificate containing the 1 domain and 2 sub-domains
5.  once the certificates have been generated you should find them in this example in ```/etc/letsencrypt/live/shock.openshock.local/``` if you are working with 3 subdomains or ```/etc/letsencrypt/live/openshock.local/``` if you are using 1 domain + 2 subdomains.

### Docker compose setup
Make a new folder in a known location.

Add two files with the names `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`. Paste their contents from below.

??? "docker-compose.yml"
    ```yaml

    # This file is a minimal plug and play working example of a runnable OpenShock stack.
    services:
    
      db: # We need a postgres database, preferably version 15+

    1.  Primary postgres database password. Make it something secure like a random 32 character password.
    2.  Application domain. e.g. `openshock.app`
    3.  Gateway subdomain. Can be left as is. e.g. `de1-gateway`
    4.  API subdomain. Default is `api`

These two can also be found in the [API repository](https://github.com/OpenShock/API)

#### Variables that must be changed in `.env`:

- `PG_PASS` is your primary postgres database password. Make it something secure like a random 32 character password.
- `OPENSHOCK_DOMAIN` change this to your domain name. e.g. openshock.app
- Email configuration. You need to decide between SMTP and MAILJET for your email sending service. Email server is currently required, this may change in the future.

You can change other variables in the `docker-compose.yml`. Check the [API README](https://github.com/OpenShock/API) for more information on the environment variables.

PS: the .env file is only actually used for variables in the docker-compose file itself and as the env_file for the api container. Feel free to change this.

### Reverse proxy

By default the reverse proxy that comes with this example is traefik. Everything should be setup and should be available under https on port 443 on your domain if done correctly.

If you decide to have your own reverse proxy or just straight up use a different domain for short urls, you need to setup redirects.

- `/s/$` -> `/#/public/proxy/shares/link/$`
- `/c/$` -> `/#/public/proxy/shares/code/$`
- `/t/$` -> `/#/public/proxy/shares/token/$`

There is a short hand letter, that redirects to the webui url, with this prefix added, and `$` being a placeholder.

This setup also assumes that your frontend is for example under `openshock.app`. And API and Gateway are subdomains of the current domain name.
If you want to have your frontend also be under a subdomain, you will need to edit the reverse proxy todo so. And set the frontend urls environment variables accordingly.

#### NGINX reverse proxy example with custom SSL

We can use this modified docker-compose.yml, difference here is, we removed traefik and added nginx.
In addition we also need a ssl certificate, change the path to your needs, and create a `nginx-site.conf` file.

<!--
for some reason i still have the bug with certicat i installed a 0 machine nothing to do even copy paste the certificate to make it work i modified the docker compose of nginx 
by adding in volumes (the domain name is an example)
- /etc/letsencrypt/live/openshock.local/fullchain.pem:/certs/fullchain.pem:ro
- /etc/letsencrypt/live/openshock.local/privkey.pem:/certs/privkey.pem:ro

## Done

Congratulations, the backend and website should be working now. :partying_face:

You can now set the backend domain for the firmware to your api url via the `domain` serial command.
<!--actually I managed to bug on it probably due to fatigue and such but the more precise it is the less you'll have people like me who are sometimes in a fog. -->
To do this, simply go to your arduino ide, plug in your esp32 in usb, go to the serial monitor and write, for example 
```domain api.sock.openshock.local``` or using one domain and 2 subdomain ```domain api.openshock.local``` (to be adapted to your own domain that you defined in the .env) then press enter. You should get confirmation that it's using your 3 subdomain.
